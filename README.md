Development of an optimal cruise control system

Linear Programming, Quadratic Programming, Multi-Objective Optimization Project

Scenario
• Develop an optimal control cruise contrl system for a car.
• You should use the optimal identification and control procedures to:
	• Obtain a mathematical model of the car
	• Optimal automatic control of the car throtle in order to maintain the desired speed.
